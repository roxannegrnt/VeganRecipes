Ingredients
2 medium to large ripe avocados, halved, pit removed
1 lemon, juiced (2 Tbsp or 30 ml)
1 heaping Tbsp (8 g) chopped sun-dried tomatoes
3 Tbsp (30 g) diced ripe cherry tomato
1/4 cup (40 g) diced red onion
1 tsp dried oregano (or 2 tsp fresh)
2 Tbsp fresh (7 g) chopped parsley
optional: 4 kalamata olives, pitted and chopped
Sea salt and black pepper to taste (~1/8th tsp each)
Instructions
Add avocado and lemon juice to a large mixing bowl and use a potato masher, pastry cutter, or large fork to mash and mix.
Add remaining ingredients (olives are optional), and stir to combine (see photo). Sample and add salt and pepper if needed.
Adjust other flavors if needed, adding more lemon for acidity, sun-dried tomato for deeper tomato flavor, onion for crunch/spice, or parsley or oregano.
Enjoy immediately with pita, pita chips, or vegetables! Best when fresh, though leftovers keep in the refrigerator for 2-3 days.
